# accordion-w-accessibility-in-mind

This displays an example of a vanilla js accordion feature. The accordion headers are made of buttons, giving them natural accessibility functionality. Furthermore, if the accordion is not open, it will not focus on the inner links. If an accordion panel is open, then a user can keyboard navigate to the links.
